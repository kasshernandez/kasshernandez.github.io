My name is Kassandra Hernandez. I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at UC Berkeley. My research intersects labor economics and public finance.

I am also a Graduate Student Researcher with the [Low-wage Work](https://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/low-wage-work/) (LWW) team at the [UC Berkeley Labor Center](https://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/), where I co-buit the ["Low-wage Work in California Data Explorer."](https://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/low-wage-work-in-california-data-explorer-2024/) Before joining LWW, I supported work on social safety net program usage and college student success through the [California Policy Lab](https://capolicylab.org/).

I hold an M.P.P. and a B.A. in Philosophy with a minor in Labor & Workplace Studies, both from UCLA, and am an alumna of the [American Economic Association Summer Program](https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/committees/AEASP) (AEASP). 

I am a proud Californian, daughter of Mexican immigrants, and first-generation college student. In my free time, I immerse myself in natureâ€”mostly running, cycling, camping, and backpacking. I completed my first marathon in March 2024 in Napa, inspired by my childhood growing up on a vineyard in the Santa Monica mountains.
