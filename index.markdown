Thanks for stopping by! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in [Economics at UC Berkeley](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/). Trained in labor economics and public finance, I study how public policy exacerbates or mitigates inequality, particularly for low-wage workers and immigrants. Feel free to learn more [about me](\about\) and my [research](\research\).
