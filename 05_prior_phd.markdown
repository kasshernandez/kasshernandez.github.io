Prior to starting the Ph.D., I was a research analyst at the [UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Institute](https://latino.ucla.edu/), focusing on economic mobility and opportunity and COVID-19 impacts on the Latinx community. 

My work has been covered in both English and Spanish media and was presented to members of the U.S. Department of State, Department of Labor, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Check out the [policy reports](\policy\) I co-authored during my time there.
