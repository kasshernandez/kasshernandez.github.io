I am passionate about improving access, representation, and inclusivity throughout all levels of the Economics pipeline. As a Latina, daughter of Mexican immigrants, and first-generation college student, I have greatly benefited from intentional mentorship, leadership, and advocacy. At UC Berkeley, I have been heavily engaged through student-led initiatives and I aim to do the same throughout my career.
