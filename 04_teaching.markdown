I have led and collaborated with others on various teaching teams at UC Berkeley and UCLA, for both undergraduate- and graduate-level courses. As an instructor, I am passionate about student learning; my pedagogy strives to build confidence and clarity within the classroomâ€”especially for students traditionally underrepresented in Economics, Policy, and related fields. 

I am happy to provide teaching evaluations upon request.
